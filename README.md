This game was made to practice for future game jams, and to show off my skills. For this game, I replicated the limitations from Mini Jame Gam #26: the theme was "You are the villain", and the special object was "Car". There was a time limit of roughly three days. All files created for this game were made within the time limit, and it was all made from scratch by me alone. Yes, that includes the graphics and audio.
